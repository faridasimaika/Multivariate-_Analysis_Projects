# Multivariate_Analysis_Projects
Welcome to the Multivariate Analysis Repository! This collection features projects applying Outlier Detection, Hotelling's T2 test, Discriminant Analysis and Cluster Analysis. One notable project involves the comprehensive analysis of a wine dataset, using these methods to assess quality, identify outliers, and understand chemical composition patterns for nuanced insights.

## Key Components

### 1. Outlier Detection & Hotelling's T2 Test 

- [R Code](https://github.com/faridasimaika/Multivariate_Analysis_Projects/blob/main/Project%201%20RScript.R): This R code file demonstrates the implementation of outlier detection techniques and Hotelling's T2 test in a multivariate context.

- [Report](https://github.com/faridasimaika/Multivariate_Analysis_Projects/blob/main/Project%201%20Report.pdf): A report summarizing the results and insights gained from the outlier detection analysis and Hotelling's T2 test.

### 2. Discriminant Analysis & Cluster Analysis

- [Discriminant Analysis Code](https://github.com/faridasimaika/Multivariate_Analysis_Projects/blob/main/FLDA%20Project%202%20-%20Rscript%20-%20Farida%20%26Katia.R): R code for executing discriminant analysis techniques.

- [Cluster Analysis Code](https://github.com/faridasimaika/Multivariate_Analysis_Projects/blob/main/Clustering.R): R code showcasing the application of cluster analysis algorithms.

- [Report](https://github.com/faridasimaika/Multivariate_Analysis_Projects/blob/main/Discriminant%20Analysis%20and%20Clustering%20Project%20-%20Multivariate.pdf): A report outlining the findings and implications derived from both discriminant and cluster analysis.
