# Multivariate_Analysis_Projects
Welcome to the Multivariate Analysis Repository! This collection features projects applying Outlier Detection, Hotelling's T2 test, Discriminant Analysis, and Cluster Analysis. One notable project involves the comprehensive analysis of a wine dataset, using these methods to assess quality, identify outliers, and understand chemical composition patterns for nuanced insights.

## Key Components

### 1. Outlier Detection & Hotelling's T2 Test 

- **[`outlier_detection.R`](Outlier_Detection/outlier_detection.R)**: This R code file demonstrates the implementation of outlier detection techniques and Hotelling's T2 test in a multivariate context.

- **[`outlier_detection_report.pdf`](Outlier_Detection/outlier_detection_report.pdf)**: A report summarizing the results and insights gained from the outlier detection analysis and  Hotelling's T2 test.
- 

### 2. Discriminant Analysis

- **[`discriminant_analysis.R`](Discriminant_Analysis/discriminant_analysis.R)**: R code for executing discriminant analysis techniques.

- **[`discriminant_analysis_report.pdf`](Discriminant_Analysis/discriminant_analysis_report.pdf)**: A report outlining the findings and implications derived from discriminant analysis.

### 3. Cluster Analysis

- **[`cluster_analysis.R`](Cluster_Analysis/cluster_analysis.R)**: R code showcasing the application of cluster analysis algorithms.

- **[`cluster_analysis_report.pdf`](Cluster_Analysis/cluster_analysis_report.pdf)**: A report summarizing the outcomes and insights gained through cluster analysis.
